            <p style="text-align:center; font-size: larger;">Hello, my name is Evan Padgett.</p>
            <p>I am currently a second-year undergraduate at Iowa State University pursuing a degree in Software Engineering.
                I am also a member of Triangle Fraternity. I have a few group projects under my belt, 
                and experience in several languages such as Java, C, HTML/JS/CSS, Python, as well as Racket.
                In my spare time I enjoy video game development as a hobby.

            <p style="text-align:center; font-size: larger;">Terminal-Based Chess Game</p>
            <P>A fully-featured game of chess played in the terminal where the user can choose to play with a friend in which they alternate input or play against an automated bot.
                It was written in C by my team over the course of a semester, and my area of focus was in user interaction and designing the automated opponent.

            <p>
                Designed a web-based application in HTML/CSS/JS where users can store, track, and export an expense history and compare it to the given budget.
                I was tasked with all backend logic bar exporting/importing capabilities. Pictured above is the app without any front-end work
                (as it breaks the entire app since our front-end guy decided to do no testing).
